Write-Host "This is NORMAL - backend requires authentication tokens"

Write-Host "`n‚úÖ Access Through Approuter (Should Work):" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "`nüìã What You Should See:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "1. Direct backend: 401 Unauthorized error (this is correct!)"
Write-Host "2. Approuter: Login page ‚Üí After login ‚Üí User data"

Write-Host "`nüéØ Why This Happens:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "- Backend expects JWT tokens from XSUAA"
Write-Host "- Direct access has no tokens = 401 error"
Write-Host "- Approuter handles login and adds tokens to requests"
Write-Host "- Frontend should ALWAYS go through approuter"

Write-Host "`nüí° Solution:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Always access your app through the approuter URL:"
